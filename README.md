# DuoTone Dark Faithful Themes for VSCode

Based on the [DuoTone Dark Theme for Atom](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax) by [Simurai](https://github.com/simurai). Built for Visual Studio Code.

This is based on [Simurai's own TextMate port of DuoTone Dark Sky](https://gist.github.com/simurai/de2dbbbd7eabf25bec18), and built on the framework created by [Sallar](https://github.com/sallar)
for his [VSCode DuoTone Dark theme](https://github.com/sallar/vscode-duotone-dark) to generalize it and generate themes for any variation.
